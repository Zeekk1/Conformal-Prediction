This project explores conformal prediction methods to improve the reliability and fairness of deep learning models for chest X-ray image classification.
ResNet-18 and ResNet-152 are used as the base model, then fine-tuned on the two large image datasets(~64 GB).
The implementation leverages PyTorch and TorchCP, enabling uncertainty estimation and performance evaluation..
